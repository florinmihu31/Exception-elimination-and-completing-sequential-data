# Exception Elimination and Completing Sequential Data

### Description

* Homework for the Data Structure course.
* This project aims the handling of a large amount of data used for machine learning, focusing on the list data structure.
* The homework targeted solving possible problems that can occur when working with a large amount of data such as:
    * Data which should not be present (outlier)
    * Missing data within a time period (gaps)
    * Noisy data
    * Unevenly distributed data
* The project consists of functions for exception elimination using statistical methods, noise filtering, data frequency uniformity and data completion.


### Languages

* The application was written in C for a better understanding of the list data structure.
